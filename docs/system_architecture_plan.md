### **Classes & Responsibilities**

Based on the system pipeline and the "Abstraction & Code Structure" section, here are potential class abstractions with their purposes and responsibilities:

        - Format and broadcast these updates to the frontend in a structured manner.

### **OOP & SOLID Best Practices**

Applying OOP and SOLID principles will lead to a more maintainable and extensible system:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class should have one specific responsibility. For example, `PromptRunner` only deals with executing prompts, and `DatabaseService` only handles database interactions. This makes classes easier to understand, test, and modify.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. For instance, if we want to support a new LLM, we should be able to add a new implementation of the `PromptRunner` interface without modifying the existing `PromptRunner` class or the classes that depend on it.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not concretions. For example, the `ComponentExtractor` should depend on an abstract `PromptRunner` interface, not a concrete `OpenAIClient`. This makes it easier to switch LLM providers or mock dependencies for testing.
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor combining objects through composition rather than inheriting from base classes. For example, instead of having `OpenAIPromptRunner` inherit from a generic `PromptRunner`, a `PromptRunner` class could *have a* dependency on an `OpenAIClient` object. This leads to more flexible and less tightly coupled designs.
- **Type-Safe Data Models:** Utilize strongly typed data structures (e.g., TypeScript interfaces/types on the frontend. This helps catch errors early, improves code readability, and facilitates better data validation.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Divide the system into distinct modules or layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the functionality (e.g., data access, business logic, presentation). This makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and evolve. The proposed class abstractions already align with this principle.

### **Modularization Patterns**

Here are modularization recommendations for both backend and frontend:

**Backend:**

- **Service-Oriented Approach:** Split the logic into distinct services based on their responsibilities (as outlined in the "Classes & Responsibilities"). Each service can be a module or a set of related classes.
    - **Core Logic Services:** `ScreenshotProcessor`, `ComponentExtractor`, `ElementExtractor`, `Anchorer`, `BoundingBoxLabeler`, `AccuracyValidator`, `AnnotationRenderer`.
    - **Infrastructure Services:** `DatabaseService`, `PromptLogService`, `SupabaseStorageService` (to abstract Supabase Storage interactions), `RealtimeUpdateService`.
    - **Orchestration Service:** `BatchProcessingService` to coordinate the workflow.
- **Next.js API Routes Structure:** Organize API routes based on the entities and actions they handle. For example:
    - `/api/batches/create`: Handles creating a new batch.
    - `/api/batches/[batchId]`: Provides information about a specific batch.
    - `/api/batches/[batchId]/process`: Triggers the processing of a batch.
    - `/api/screenshots`: Handles screenshot uploads and retrieval.
    - `/api/components/[componentId]`: Provides component details.
    - `/api/elements/[elementId]`: Provides element details.
    - `/api/logs`: Endpoint for fetching real-time logs (potentially via WebSockets).
- **Supabase Integration:** Encapsulate Supabase client interactions within the `DatabaseService` and `SupabaseStorageService`. This isolates the application logic from the specific database implementation, making it easier to switch databases in the future if needed. Use Supabase's client libraries within these services.
- **Serverless-Friendly Job Execution and Threading:**
    - **Background Jobs:** For long-running tasks like batch processing, consider using serverless functions triggered by events (e.g., after a new batch is created in the database or a new screenshot is uploaded). Supabase Functions or Vercel Background Functions could be used for this.
    - **Concurrency:** Within a serverless function, leverage asynchronous programming (`async/await`) and potentially lightweight threading or task management libraries (if the serverless environment allows) to process multiple screenshots or components in parallel. Be mindful of resource limits in serverless environments.

**Frontend:**

- **Component-Based Architecture (React):** Leverage React's component model to break down the UI into reusable and manageable pieces (e.g., `ScreenshotCarousel`, `ComponentList`, `ElementTable`, `BoundingBoxOverlay`, `LogDisplay`).
- **State Management:** Employ a robust state management library (e.g., Zustand, Recoil, or Redux Toolkit) to manage the complex, deeply nested UI state related to batches, screenshots, components, and elements. Consider modularizing the state into slices or modules based on the different entities.
- **API Client:** Create a dedicated module or service for interacting with the backend API routes. This encapsulates API call logic and makes it easier to manage API endpoints and data fetching.

### **Advanced Architecture Suggestions**

Here are additional architectural and coding best practices:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Elements:**
    - **Entities:** `Batch`, `Screenshot`, `Component`, `Element` are core entities with unique identities and lifecycles.
    - **Value Objects:** `BoundingBox`, `AccuracyScore`, `PromptMetadata` (time taken, tokens, cost) can be treated as value objects – immutable objects that represent a concept.
    - **Aggregates:** Consider `Batch` as an aggregate root, encapsulating `Screenshot` entities. Changes to screenshots within a batch should typically go through the `Batch` entity.
    - **Services:** The backend logic classes (`ComponentExtractor`, `ElementExtractor`, etc.) act as domain services, performing operations that don't naturally belong to a specific entity.
    - **Repositories:** Implement repository interfaces (e.g., `BatchRepository`, `ComponentRepository`) in the `DatabaseService` to abstract data access logic from the domain services.
- **Service Abstraction Patterns:**
    - **Repository Pattern:** As mentioned, use repositories to abstract data access, making the domain logic independent of the specific database implementation.
    - **Orchestration vs. Coordination:** The `BatchProcessingService` acts as an orchestrator, directing the flow of operations across different services. Individual services like `ComponentExtractor` coordinate their internal steps.
- **Event-Driven State Tracking:** Consider using events to track the progress of batch processing and individual tasks. For example, when a screenshot is uploaded, a "ScreenshotUploaded" event could be emitted. Other services (like the component extractor or the real-time update service) can subscribe to these events and react accordingly. This promotes loose coupling and better scalability. Supabase Realtime could be leveraged for some aspects of this.
