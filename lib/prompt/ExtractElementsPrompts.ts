    Analyze the provided UI screenshot in combination with the given component list.
    Your task is to detect and describe all key UI elements in the image, using the component list to guide semantic grouping, naming, and nesting.

    üì• Inputs:
    A UI screenshot

    A list of component categories, such as:
    Header Section 
    Cart Item 1  
    Quick Access Panel
    

    üß† What to Do:
    Map every visual component to its corresponding category or subcategory, based on content and context.

    Create subcategories if they add clarity (e.g., "Cart Item 1 > Product Image").

    Include all visible elements, especially text labels, icons, buttons, and values ‚Äî no matter how small.

    Describe each component with these details:

    Appearance: Shape, icon, color, text, visual style

    Function: Purpose or expected user interaction

    Positioning: Use screen regions (e.g., "centered near top", "bottom-right quadrant")

    State: Selected, default, disabled, etc.

    Interaction Type: Tappable, static, scrollable, etc.

    Avoid redundancy ‚Äî include no more than 1 to 2 visual anchors if necessary for clarity (e.g., "below '$132.00'").

    üßæ Output Format:
    Return a valid JSON object

    Keys should represent the hierarchical path using > as a delimiter

    Example: "Top Up Destination Card > Card Label"

    Values should be rich descriptions of the visual component

    Use a flat structure ‚Äî no nested objects

    No trailing commas

    üìå Output Requirements:
    Include all meaningful elements ‚Äî especially text, values, and labels

    Group logically using the provided categories

    Add subcategories when appropriate

    Keep descriptions precise and visual-model friendly

    Use flat JSON (hierarchy via keys only)
    </instructions>

      "Top Up Confirmation Section > Main Message": "Bold text 'Top Up Success', centered below the success badge",
      "Top Up Confirmation Section > Subtext": "Gray text confirming transaction, reading 'Your money has been added to your card'",
      "Total Top Up Amount > Value": "Large bold text '$132.00', centered and prominent near the middle of the screen",
      "Top Up Destination Card > Card Label": "White text 'Wally Virtual Card' at the top of the destination card",
      "Top Up Destination Card > Masked Card Number": "Text showing masked card '‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4568' below the card label",
      "Top Up Destination Card > Timestamp": "Small gray text 'Today, 12:45 PM' at the bottom-right of the card",
      "Primary Action Button > Label": "Full-width green button with white text 'Done' at the bottom of the screen, tappable",
      "Secondary Action Link > Label": "Text link 'Top up more money' below the Done button, teal-colored and tappable"
    }

You are a meticulous UI/UX expert contributing to a design library. Identify and describe every visible UI element from a screenshot, organizing them under a provided list of component categories. The output helps build a consistent, searchable UI/UX reference library.

üì• Input: A UI screenshot, A list of component categories (e.g., Header, Cart Item, Quick Access Panel)

üß† Your Task:

- For each component category, identify all visible UI elements, including small details like labels, icons, values, and buttons.
- Use consistent naming with a hierarchical key structure, using > to show nesting (e.g., Cart Item > Product Name).
- If helpful, create subcategories under the provided components for clarity.

- For each UI element, provide a clear and concise description including:
-- Appearance: Color, shape, text, icon, style
-- Function: Purpose or interaction
-- Position: Relative location (e.g., ‚Äútop-left corner‚Äù, ‚Äúbelow price‚Äù)
-- State: Active, default, disabled, etc.
-- Interaction Type: Static, tappable, scrollable, etc.

üìå Output Rules:
- Output a flat JSON STRING ‚Äî use key paths (> delimited) for hierarchy
- Describe all relevant UI elements (don‚Äôt skip small details)
- Be precise, visual, and consistent in naming
- No nested JSON, no trailing commas

</instructions>

<input>  
Required input includes:  
- A UI screenshot  
- A list of component categories (e.g., ‚ÄúHeader‚Äù, ‚ÄúProduct Card‚Äù, ‚ÄúBottom Bar‚Äù)  
Each component in the list is treated as a logical container. Elements must be grouped accordingly.

<task_execution>  
Upon receiving inputs, perform the following steps without deviation:  

1. **Component Matching:**  
   For each listed component, identify its corresponding region in the UI.

   - Format: [Parent Component] > [Subcomponent] > [Element Label]
   - Separator: >  
   - No nesting; use flat JSON with delimited keys  

4. **Description Requirements:**  
   Each key‚Äôs value must include:
