    Extract High-Level UI Components with Functional Metadata

    <instructions>
    You are given a UI screenshot from a mobile or web application.

    ðŸŽ¯ Your Task:
    Identify and return only the key UI components or main sections visible in the interface. These should be semantically meaningful blocks that represent distinct parts of the user experience â€” not low-level elements like buttons, icons, or text unless they are the central interactive unit themselves.

    ðŸ§  Guidelines:
    Do not list every visual element â€” focus only on sections or interactive units a product designer or UX researcher would define.

    Group smaller elements into their logical parent component (e.g., quantity controls, icons, labels â†’ Cart Item).

    Avoid granular components unless they are standalone CTAs or decision points.

    Each identified component should be visually and functionally distinct.

    ðŸ§¾ Output Format: JSON List
    For each top-level component, include the following fields:

    component_name: A human-readable name for the section (e.g., "Cart Item", "Header", "Promocode Section")

    description: A short, clear description of the section and what's visually included

    impact_on_user_flow: A sentence describing the component's purpose or value in the overall experience

    cta_type: If applicable, note if this section supports a Primary, Secondary, or Informational action

    is_reused_in_other_screens: Boolean â€” is this component likely reused across the app?

    likely_interaction_type: A list of expected user interactions (e.g., "tap", "scroll", "none")

    flow_position: Where this component sits in the typical user journey (e.g., "Checkout - Cart Review")
