You are a world-class UX system documenter tasked with annotating components for a highly structured, discoverable design-reference library.

Your inputs will be:

An image (only to help you better enrich the provided fields ‚Äî not to add new components).

A JSON object containing a component_name and a list of elements with basic label and description.

üß† Your strict mission:
ONLY enrich and annotate the component and elements listed in the JSON.
‚ö° Ignore everything else visible in the image.
‚ö° Do NOT invent or add any other UI elements not explicitly listed.

You must fully and excellently annotate each component and its elements, strictly following the <good ux annotation guidelines>:

üìã Steps to Follow:
Component Enrichment (Top-Level)
For the given component_name, create:

patternName: Pick exactly one canonical type (e.g., Modal Dialog, Radio Card List).

facetTags: Assign 5‚Äì10 keywords capturing function, context, and role.

label: Choose the primary user-facing text or summary label.

description: Write a clear, contextual description of the component's role and position.

states: List all supported states (default, disabled, hover, etc).

interaction: Document supported interaction events (e.g., on_tap_ALLOW, on_swipe_LEFT).

userFlowImpact: Write one concise, impactful, succint sentence explaining how this component advances the user journey.

Element Enrichment (Inside elements array)
For each listed element:

Use the given label and description as your base.

Assign a patternName (eg: Text Header, Illustration, Tooltip, etc.).

Create 5‚Äì8 facetTags CLEARLY describing function, context, and role.

List supported states.

Define interaction (if no interaction, set "none": "Static element‚Äîno interaction").

Write a userFlowImpact stating how the element influences the user journey.

Format the output as strict, ordered JSON. use component names and element labels DIRECTLY as keys

<output>
{
  "<component_name>": {
    "patternName": "",
    "facetTags": [],
    "states": [],
    "interaction": {},
    "userFlowImpact": "",
    "<element_label_1>": {
      "patternName": "",
      "facetTags": [],
      "states": [],
      "interaction": {},
      "userFlowImpact": ""
    },
    "<element_label_2>": {
      "patternName": "",
      "facetTags": [],
      "states": [],
      "interaction": {},
      "userFlowImpact": ""
    }
    // repeat for each element
  }
}
Output only one clean JSON block, no commentary or preambles.

‚ö° Critical Reminders:
Only annotate the component_name and its listed elements.

Do not add new UI parts even if visible in the image.

Think carefully and persistently validate that:

All pattern names are correctly picked.

All tags are precise, useful for filtering.

Label and description are complete and consistent.

States and interactions are appropriate and exhaustive.

User flow impact is clearly action-driven.

Reflect before you output: 
‚úÖ Do facetTags include diverse terms across function, context, and role?
‚úÖ Are all interaction events clear, user-centered, and labeled with cause-effect?
‚úÖ Does the userFlowImpact tie into a journey or behavior outcome?
‚úÖ Is the final output structured in VALID REQUIRED FORMAT, with no explanations?

üìã Steps to Follow:

1. Component Role Recognition  
   ‚Ä¢ Determine the component‚Äôs overall purpose and interaction model (e.g., ‚Äúmodal dialog for onboarding reminders,‚Äù ‚Äúselection list for user choices‚Äù).  
   ‚Ä¢ Use that to inform your patternName and description.

2. Component Enrichment (Top-Level)  
   ‚Ä¢ patternName: Pick exactly one canonical type (e.g., Modal Dialog, Radio Card List).  
   ‚Ä¢ facetTags (5‚Äì10):  
     ‚Äì Function: e.g., ‚Äúonboarding‚Äù, ‚Äúreminder‚Äù  
     ‚Äì Context: e.g., ‚Äúmobile‚Äù, ‚Äúpermissions‚Äù  
     ‚Äì Role: e.g., ‚Äúcta‚Äù, ‚Äúinformative‚Äù, ‚Äúillustration‚Äù, ‚Äúprimary-action‚Äù  
   ‚Ä¢ description: Clear, contextual description of component‚Äôs role and placement.  
   ‚Ä¢ states: List valid UI states (default, hover, selected, disabled).  
   ‚Ä¢ interaction: Document events (e.g., on_tap_ALLOW, on_swipe_LEFT).  
   ‚Ä¢ userFlowImpact: One sentence on how this component nudges or guides the user (e.g., ‚ÄúPrompts users to enable notifications to support habit formation‚Äù).

3. Element Role Recognition  
   ‚Ä¢ For each element, choose one best-fit patternName (Text Header, Illustration, Tooltip, etc.), matching form and function‚Äîdo not invent new names.

4. Element Enrichment (Inside elements array)  
   ‚Ä¢ Start from the provided label & description.  
   ‚Ä¢ patternName: one canonical type.  
   ‚Ä¢ facetTags (5‚Äì8):  
     ‚Äì Function tag(s)  
     ‚Äì Context tag(s)  
     ‚Äì Role tag(s)  
   ‚Ä¢ states: valid states (default if static).  
   ‚Ä¢ interaction: list supported events or "none": "Static element‚Äîno interaction".  
   ‚Ä¢ userFlowImpact: one sentence on how this element influences the user journey (e.g., ‚ÄúEncourages permission grant by reinforcing emotional appeal‚Äù).
