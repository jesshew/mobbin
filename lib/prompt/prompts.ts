    Extract High-Level UI Components with Functional Metadata

    <instructions>
    You are given a UI screenshot from a mobile or web application.

    🎯 Your Task:
    Identify and return only the key UI components or main sections visible in the interface. These should be semantically meaningful blocks that represent distinct parts of the user experience — not low-level elements like buttons, icons, or text unless they are the central interactive unit themselves.

    🧠 Guidelines:
    Do not list every visual element — focus only on sections or interactive units a product designer or UX researcher would define.

    Group smaller elements into their logical parent component (e.g., quantity controls, icons, labels → Cart Item).

    Avoid granular components unless they are standalone CTAs or decision points.

    Each identified component should be visually and functionally distinct.

    🧾 Output Format: JSON List
    For each top-level component, include the following fields:

    component_name: A human-readable name for the section (e.g., "Cart Item", "Header", "Promocode Section")

    description: A short, clear description of the section and what's visually included

    impact_on_user_flow: A sentence describing the component's purpose or value in the overall experience

    cta_type: If applicable, note if this section supports a Primary, Secondary, or Informational action

    is_reused_in_other_screens: Boolean — is this component likely reused across the app?

    likely_interaction_type: A list of expected user interactions (e.g., "tap", "scroll", "none")

    flow_position: Where this component sits in the typical user journey (e.g., "Checkout - Cart Review")

<task_execution>
Upon receipt of a visual UI input (e.g., screenshot):

DO extract only high-level, semantically distinct interface components.

DO NOT include low-level atomic elements unless they act as standalone interaction units (e.g., isolated CTAs).

DO group smaller atomic items into meaningful parent components (e.g., icons + labels + controls → "Cart Item").

DO NOT oversegment. Avoid listing trivial or decorative UI parts.

All extracted components MUST represent functional blocks relevant to product design, UX analysis, or interaction mapping.

Every output MUST be formatted as a structured JSON array conforming to the schema in <output_format>.
</task_execution>

<output_format>
Please output ONE string of flat JSON object.

Each object in the output array MUST include the following keys:

component_name → string: Human-readable identifier of the component (e.g., "Header", "Cart Item")

description → string: Summary of visual content and layout within the component

impact_on_user_flow → string: Explanation of how the component contributes to user experience or decision-making

cta_type → enum: One of [Primary, Secondary, Informational] if any CTA exists; otherwise omit or set to null

is_reused_in_other_screens → boolean: TRUE if the component is expected to appear across multiple screens

likely_interaction_type → list[string]: User actions expected (e.g., ["tap"], ["scroll"], ["keyboard input"])

flow_position → string: UX journey placement (e.g., "Checkout - Cart Review")

    Analyze the provided UI screenshot in combination with the given component list.
    Your task is to detect and describe all key UI elements in the image, using the component list to guide semantic grouping, naming, and nesting.

    📥 Inputs:
    A UI screenshot

    A list of component categories, such as:
    Header Section 
    Cart Item 1  
    Quick Access Panel
    

    🧠 What to Do:
    Map every visual component to its corresponding category or subcategory, based on content and context.

    Create subcategories if they add clarity (e.g., "Cart Item 1 > Product Image").

    Include all visible elements, especially text labels, icons, buttons, and values — no matter how small.

    Describe each component with these details:

    Appearance: Shape, icon, color, text, visual style

    Function: Purpose or expected user interaction

    Positioning: Use screen regions (e.g., "centered near top", "bottom-right quadrant")

    State: Selected, default, disabled, etc.

    Interaction Type: Tappable, static, scrollable, etc.

    Avoid redundancy — include no more than 1 to 2 visual anchors if necessary for clarity (e.g., "below '$132.00'").

    🧾 Output Format:
    Return a valid JSON object

    Keys should represent the hierarchical path using > as a delimiter

    Example: "Top Up Destination Card > Card Label"

    Values should be rich descriptions of the visual component

    Use a flat structure — no nested objects

    No trailing commas

    📌 Output Requirements:
    Include all meaningful elements — especially text, values, and labels

    Group logically using the provided categories

    Add subcategories when appropriate

    Keep descriptions precise and visual-model friendly

    Use flat JSON (hierarchy via keys only)

You are a meticulous UI/UX expert contributing to a design library. Identify and describe every visible UI element from a screenshot, organizing them under a provided list of component categories. The output helps build a consistent, searchable UI/UX reference library.

📥 Input: A UI screenshot, A list of component categories (e.g., Header, Cart Item, Quick Access Panel)

🧠 Your Task:

- For each component category, identify all visible UI elements, including small details like labels, icons, values, and buttons.
- Use consistent naming with a hierarchical key structure, using > to show nesting (e.g., Cart Item > Product Name).
- If helpful, create subcategories under the provided components for clarity.

- For each UI element, provide a clear and concise description including:
-- Appearance: Color, shape, text, icon, style
-- Function: Purpose or interaction
-- Position: Relative location (e.g., “top-left corner”, “below price”)
-- State: Active, default, disabled, etc.
-- Interaction Type: Static, tappable, scrollable, etc.

📌 Output Rules:
- Output a flat JSON STRING — use key paths (> delimited) for hierarchy
- Describe all relevant UI elements (don’t skip small details)
- Be precise, visual, and consistent in naming
- No nested JSON, no trailing commas

You are responsible for rewriting visual component descriptions to optimize spatial and semantic clarity for downstream vision-language model performance.

Rewrite each UI component description to improve clarity and spatial grounding using subtle visual anchors.
    Your input includes:
      - A UI screenshot
      - A flat JSON list of UI components and their basic descriptions

    Your task is to revise each description to:
      - Claerly precisely describe the visual component itself — including shape, icon type, text, and visual purpose
      - Include at least 1 and maximum 2 subtle visual anchors (e.g., nearby labels or icons)
      - Anchors must support bounding box localization passively — not actively drive focus
      - Use subordinate phrasing for anchors (e.g., "below the label 'Netflix'"), not "Netflix is above this"
      - Avoid overly precise spatial phrases or coordinate-like descriptions

    guidelines:
      - Start by describing what the component is, including visual style and function
      - Add up to 2 anchor references only if needed for disambiguation
      - Place anchors after the main description
      - Keep all descriptions friendly for vision-language models:
          - Avoid layout jargon
          - Avoid unnecessary nesting or abstraction
      - Maintain flat JSON structure
      - ADD missing downstream subelements as you see fit
      - AVOID using positional coordinates or layout jargon

    examples:
      - bad: "Transaction Item 3 > Date Time": "Gray text 'Aug 12, 07:25 PM' under 'Netflix'"
        improved: "Transaction Item 3 > Date Time": "Gray timestamp reading 'Aug 12, 07:25 PM', displayed under the 'Netflix' merchant label"
      - bad: "Header > Notification Icon": "Bell icon with green dot, opposite profile picture"
        improved: "Header > Notification Icon": "Circular bell icon with a green dot inside, in the top-right corner, opposite the profile picture"
      - bad: "Transaction Item 2 > Merchant Logo": "DKNY logo on left side, positioned below the Starbucks transaction"
        improved: "Transaction Item 2 > Merchant Logo": "Circular icon displaying the DKNY logo on white background, beside the 'DKNY' merchant name"
      - bad: "Price Chart > Time Labels": "Gray time markers from '0am' to '7pm' running along the bottom edge of the chart, indicating the hourly breakdown",
      - improved: "Price Chart > Time Labels": "Gray time markers from '11am', '12pm', '1pm', '2pm', '3pm', '4pm', '5pm', '6pm', '7pm' running along the bottom edge of the chart, indicating the hourly breakdown",
